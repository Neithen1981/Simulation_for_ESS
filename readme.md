# Simulation for ESS

#### The four versions of simulation are for "battle of sexes", a well-studied scene in evolutionary biology. It can be generalized to any long-term simulation of two gender strategies.

`ed2.py`: no fixed sex ratio

`ed3.py`: fixed sex ratio

`ed4.py`: fixed sex ratio, "cunning" philanderer

`ed5.py`: no fixed ratio, "cunning" philanderer

I recommend try `ed2.py` and `ed3.py` using the initial setting first.

Explanation and discussion are in the Sides.

Thanks and have fun!
