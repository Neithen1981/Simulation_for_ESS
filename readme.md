# Simulation for ESS

##### The four versions of simulation are for "battle of sexes", a well-studied scene in evolutionary biology. It can be generalized to any long-term simulation of two gender strategies.

'ed2.py': no fixed sex ratio
'ed3.py': fixed sex ratios
'ed4.py': fixed sex ratio, varies in strategy

I recommend try 'ed2.py' and 'ed3.py' using the initial setting first.

Explanation and discussion are in the Sides.
